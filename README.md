# ATM Management System

## Introduction

The ATM Management System is a software project aimed at improving the efficiency and ease of accessing banking services for customers. The application allows users to access their bank accounts in order to make cash withdrawals. 

This system is developed in Visual Basic (VB) with a backend database powered by MS-Access. The ATM Management System communicates each transaction to the database for verification and updates the account balance as transactions occur. 

## Features

- User authentication via Personal Identification Number (PIN)
- Cash withdrawal transactions
- Balance inquiries
- Ensures data integrity, consistency, and security
- Concurrency control to handle multiple transactions
- Intuitive interface

## Database Design

The backend database of this system is designed using MS-Access. Some key features of this design include:

- Control of data redundancy
- Maintenance of data integrity and consistency
- Concurrency control to handle simultaneous transactions
- Security and authorization measures to protect customer data
- Variety of interfaces for different user interactions

The database design also includes the identification of unique fields, establishment of relationships between tables, and normalization to eliminate any dependencies between columns of tables. 

## Project Implementation

This project uses various MS-Access objects, including:

- Forms collection: Used to refer to forms that are currently open.
- Queries collection: Describes instances of all queries specified by current data.
- Module object: Includes class modules that are not associated with any object, and form modules and report modules, which are associated with a form or report.
- Macros: Used to automate repetitive tasks. Often attached to buttons that appear on forms to facilitate data entry work.

The project also includes creating tables as a fundamental building block of an accessed database. The entire database must have at least one table, which stores the data. Each column of the table is called a field and each row represents one record.
